# Chicago Crime Checker

The purpose of this tool is to parse the city of Chicagos crime information to show the frequency of different crimes based off of the Chicago's police department District and Beat maps. There is additional functionality as it will give every beat a score based off of a weighted list of crimes (i.e. one gives crimes a weight of severity).
